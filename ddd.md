Project Description

In this project, you will design and implement a multi-agent AI system for automated trading. The system will simulate how trading happens automatically by using several intelligent agents that communicate and coordinate with each other.

Each agent will have a specific role, and together they will complete the trading process.

Required Agents:
 1. Market Monitoring Agent
 • Monitors financial market data (prices, trends)
 • Sends information to other agents
 2. Decision-Making Agent
 • Analyzes the received data
 • Makes decisions: BUY, SELL, or HOLD
 3. Execution Agent
 • Executes the trade
 • Records and confirms the action

The project must clearly demonstrate:
 • Communication between agents
 • Coordination of tasks
 • Decision flow between agents
